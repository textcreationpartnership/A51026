            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Towns</hi> you Repreſent, are not only the Seats of Trade and Commerce, but likewiſe, ſome of them are the <hi>Fountains</hi> of Breeding, the <hi>Seminaries</hi> of Learning to the Young <hi>Nobilitie</hi> and <hi>Gentrie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93145:3"/>the <hi>Springs</hi> of good Manners and Laudable Cuſtoms to the adjacent Parts: Nay the meaneſt of them are Repaired to, leſs or more by the Neighbouring places, for Training up their Children: So that it is to the good Order and Diſcipline which a <hi>Vigilant Magiſtracie</hi> cauſes be obſerved in them; We owe that our Youth are poliſhed in any part of Civil Education, Refined from the Dreggs of a <hi>Rural life,</hi> and preſerved from Wickedneſs and Immortality.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Royal Burroughs</hi> are theſe <hi>Planets</hi> which by their Light and Influence diſpoſe the other parts of the <hi>Nation</hi> to a happy eultivation. They are thoſe <hi>Fountains</hi> which convey Water to Fertilize all about them, And I am ſure the <hi>Husbandmans</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour would fail, and the <hi>Landlords</hi> Revenue too, if the purſes of Citizens were not a ſpurr to the One, and a Seaſonable Supply many a time to the Other. I may ſafely allude to that <hi>Apologue</hi> of <hi>Menenlus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi> and ſay that the <hi>Royal Burroughs</hi> are the <hi>ſtomach</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> which digeſt &amp; diſtribute what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of Wealth or neceſſary commodity is by the care
<pb facs="tcp:93145:4"/>and Induſtry of Traffiquers imported to it, for the common benefit of the Kingdom, without whoſe Care and Prudent <hi>Mannagry,</hi> the other parts of the Body <hi>politick,</hi> the Head and Arms, the Ribbs, and Legs, that is the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> would Famiſh, and become unfit for Action or Motion.</p>
            <p>Is it not to the <hi>Royal Burroughs</hi> we owe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Arts, the Advancement of Trade, the Encreaſe of Wealth, the Education of Youth, the Encouragement of Induſtry? And whatſoever elſe can conduce to the Proſperity and Plenty of the <hi>Nation.</hi> Hence it comes Theſe deſerve the Name of Patriots <hi>beſt,</hi> who Be-friend the Intereſt of the Royal Burroughs <hi>moſt.</hi> Nor can there be any Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to them, but ſuch as are unnatural ſworn Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to their <hi>Country,</hi> and envy its Flouriſhing in <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Renown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not but you conſider and lay to heart, that not only the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Politick,</hi> but likewiſe the <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> concerns of the Kingdom, are a great part of your <hi>Province.</hi> The Providence of

            </p>
            <p>Would <hi>GOD, Magiſtrates</hi> were more Intent and Serious in the Work of <hi>Religion,</hi> then their own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and the Publick Affairs of the <hi>Communities</hi> they are ſeverally concerned in, would proſper the better under their Conduct;

            <p>This Diſcourſe was Preached ſome Years agoe in Commemoration of <hi>George Herriot,</hi> the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Founder of that <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> which is no leſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament for the Beauty of its Structure to the City, than its Revenue is advantagious to many of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants: Whoſe numerous Families are too heavie a burden to the Narrowneſs of their Fortunes.</p>

            <p>AMongſt all the Effects of that <hi>Self-love</hi> we bring with us to the World, and is ſo great a <hi>Predominant</hi> in our <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> there is none more early and laſting, none more <hi>Powerful</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> than that wherewith we purſue the Good-will and Eſteem of others: How timely and ſtrongly does this Paſſion diſcover it ſelf,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93145:10"/>in thoſe pleaſant harmleſs Devices, and pretty lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Arts of Inſinuation, by which our tender <hi>Young Ones,</hi> theſe mute but perſwaſive true Supplicants for favour ſeek to ingratiat themſelves with theſe about them. Nor does it expire with our <hi>Infancy,</hi> vary with the changes of our Condition, or decay with our declining Age: But grows with the ſeveral Stages of our Life, keeps Pace with the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our State, and bends with all the turnings of our Race; As we advance in Years, as we increaſe in Knowledge, as we inlarge our Store, prevail in Power, or proſper in Preferment. Yea whither we go foreward or backward in Honour, whither we riſe or fall in Imployment, it winds it ſelf with the viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude of our Fortune, and upon every Emergent preſerves an equal Pulſe under all Alterations. As this affection is the firſt that <hi>Buds,</hi> ſo it is the laſt that <hi>Withers.</hi> Moſt Men at their <hi>Exite</hi> out of the World, would be ſatisfied, that as the <hi>Sun</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Evening of a clear day, ſets in a beautiful Cloud, they could ſo change their <hi>Scene,</hi> leaving ſcattered behind them ſome bright Rayes of an immortal Reputation; Yea, the worſt of Criminals would ſtep to Eternity with good Opinion in the Hearts, and kind <hi>Verdicts</hi> from the mouths of the Spectators of their diſaſtrous end.</p>

            <p>As all the graces how amiable ſoever they be, neither ſhine alike, nor ſpeed alike, and all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues how lovely ſoever they be affect us not all alike. To this I may transfer that paſſage of the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> of he <hi>Gentiles, there is one Glory of the Sun, another Glory of the Moon, and another Glory of the Stars, for one Star differeth from another Star in Glory;</hi> So it is in the conſtelation of virtues, each of them have their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar excellencies, and proper Elogies, and how Fair ſoever they all appear, yet none of them ſhows more magnificence and ſplender, none of them Shines with more <hi>Orient Luſter,</hi> or diſperſes more benigh influences, than <hi>Beneficence</hi> or <hi>Charity:</hi> Its Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferrance is larger, its tayes ſpread further, its Efforts of more univerſal extent, and common concern to mankind, While the exerciſe of other virtues is confined to a narrower compaſs, runs in a ſtraiter Channeſs, and goes no further then a mans own or his Neighbours particular advantage, and as its theater is more Auguſt, its Circle more Ample, its Beams more Radient and Extenſive; So of them all its moſt attractive of commendation and Reſpect, all Men by a certain kind of of intereſt are eaſily inclined to extol ſuch with ſolmn acclaimations. None in all ages have been more honoured, none in all Nations have been more eſteemed or beloved, none have had a more fragrant name while they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93145:29"/>lived, or a more laſting Fame after they dyed, than ſuch as delighted in <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Bounty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>policy</hi> of Princes may make them more dreaded abroad, then Revered at home, the <hi>juſtìce</hi> of Soveraigns may reſtrain the violence of the hands, without rectifieing the Vennom of the hearts of their Subjects, the <hi>Temporance</hi> of Anchorets may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford matter for eloquent Harangues on Abſtinence and Mortification to ſome Monaſticks, without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting their minds any more then allaying their appetites; The Fortitude of Conquerours may ſecure for a time the Crowns they have ſnathced, ſubdue the necks, bind up the Tongues of the Enemies of the Glory of their Triumphs: And ſuch are neither beloved in their life, nor bemoaned at their death; but it is <hi>benificence</hi> which has appropriated to it ſelf the name of true and real <hi>goodneſs,</hi> it is this which by a welcome violence, a Victorious ſweetneſs, and a voluntary force convinces, the minds Conquers the wills, and captivates the affections of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Power</hi> by its awfull Sternes may bow the Knees of Men; <hi>Riches</hi> with the Glitterings of ſilver and gold may dazle the eyes of Men; <hi>Eloquence</hi> with its charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cadances may tickle the Ears of Men; <hi>Beauty</hi> with its Sparkling Strictures may raviſh the fancies, and inflame the paſſions of Men; <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> may raiſe the Admiration of Men, but it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to <hi>Benificence</hi> to erect Trophies, and eſtabliſh its Throne in the hearts of Men; It is rare to find a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93145:30"/>nature ſo ſtubborn, a heart ſo bruitiſh, a Soul ſo fierce as yields not an inward Veneration to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry memory of Benefactors. Behold then the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Art of winning Souls, and Vanquiſhing hearts, of begetting Friendſhip, and conciliating favour of confirming Friends, and converting Foes, of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Darling of Heaven, and delight of Men: And of this our <hi>Text</hi> is an inſtance, and the occaſion of this dayes Solemnity, a Commentary upon, and a Witneſs of it.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>further,</hi> if you conſider that in nothing we make nearer approaches to the Deity we Revere then in Works of <hi>mercy,</hi> and acts of <hi>benificence.</hi> To be <hi>like GOD</hi> was mans preſumption from the beginning, and his <hi>Neck break</hi> to the <hi>Boot:</hi> Yea and in the very abyſs of miſery into which his former vanity has now precipitated him, he retains ſome ſmack of this arrogance, and though now he reſembles but the Rubbiſh of a ſtately <hi>Cathedral,</hi> and is no more than the ruins of Innocent Man, that I may cry out, <hi>O! Quantum mutatus ab illo;</hi> Yet he affects ſtill to reſemble his Maker, Behold then an honeſt way to content this ambition, be <hi>benificent;</hi> what elſe is the importance of that phraſe,

            </p>
            <p>The common apprehenſion of mankind, and the practiſe of all times ſhew this. Since in all Ages, even moſt corrupt; Men have been ever apt to place

            <p>We would all be <hi>like GOD,</hi> but not in <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> ſo much as in <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>greatneſs, power</hi> and <hi>command,</hi> and that not to protect the <hi>Weak,</hi> or right the <hi>Oppreſſed,</hi> or relieve the <hi>Needy,</hi> but to carry all like a torrent before us, to cruſh every one that croſſes our humour, that will not bow to our Nod, that ſtands in the way of our ambitious projects, or covetous deſigns.
